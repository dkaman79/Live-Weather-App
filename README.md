# Live-Weather-App


First side project using API. 
In this particualr project, the OpenWeather App API was used to render the live data. 
Here I have created a form using HTML wherein a user can type particular name of a city and the weather along with other details pop out.
 If u want to check the current weather in any big cities in the world, this web app is for you.
